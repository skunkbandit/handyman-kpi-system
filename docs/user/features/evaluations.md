# Evaluations Guide

Evaluations are the core feature of the Handyman KPI System, allowing both self-assessment and manager evaluation of skills and tool proficiency.

## Evaluation Types

The system supports two types of evaluations:

1. **Self-Evaluations**: Completed by employees to assess their own skills and tool proficiency
2. **Manager Evaluations**: Completed by managers to evaluate employees

## Understanding the Rating Scale

Skills are rated on a standardized 1-5 scale:

| Rating | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Never - Never performed this task |
| 2 | Once/Twice - Has performed this task once or twice |
| 3 | Need training - Can perform with assistance, needs more training |
| 4 | Competent - Can perform independently but not at expert level |
| 5 | Expert - Has mastered this skill and can teach others |

## Tool Proficiency Indicators

Tool proficiency uses a dual marking system:

| Marking | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Y or N | Yes/No - Indicates whether you can operate the tool |
| TS | Truck Stock - Indicates whether you own and have the tool in your truck stock |
