## Security Overview

The Handyman KPI System is designed with security in mind, but proper configuration and maintenance are essential for maintaining a secure environment. This guide covers key security concepts and configuration options.

## Authentication Security

### Password Policies

Configure secure password policies:

1. Navigate to Admin → Security → Password Policy
2. Configure these recommended settings:
   - Minimum length: 12 characters
   - Require uppercase and lowercase letters
   - Require at least one number
   - Require at least one special character
   - Password expiration: 90 days
   - Password history: 10 previous passwords
   - Account lockout: 5 failed attempts

### Multi-Factor Authentication

Enable multi-factor authentication for added security:

1. Navigate to Admin → Security → Multi-Factor Authentication
2. Enable MFA for:
   - Admin accounts (required)
   - Manager accounts (recommended)
   - Employee accounts (optional)
3. Configure MFA methods:
   - Email one-time codes
   - Time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)
   - SMS verification (if configured)

### Session Security

Secure user sessions:

1. Navigate to Admin → Security → Session Settings
2. Configure these recommended settings:
   - Session timeout: 30 minutes of inactivity
   - Enforce single session per user
   - Regenerate session IDs on login
   - Set secure and HTTP-only cookie flags
   - Enable same-site cookie restriction

## Authorization and Access Control

### Role-Based Access Control

The system uses role-based access control with three primary roles:

1. **Admin**: Full system access, including configuration
2. **Manager**: Manage employees and perform evaluations
3. **Employee**: View own data and perform self-evaluations

Customize role permissions:
1. Navigate to Admin → Security → Roles and Permissions
2. Adjust permissions for each role as needed
3. Create custom roles for specific use cases

### User Management Best Practices

Follow these user management guidelines:

1. Create individual accounts for each user (no shared accounts)
2. Assign the minimum permissions needed for each role
3. Remove or deactivate accounts when employees leave
4. Regularly audit user accounts and permissions
5. Use the "force password change" option for temporary credentials

## Data Protection

### Database Security

Secure the database:

1. For production, use PostgreSQL with encrypted connections
2. Implement database-level access controls
3. Use strong, randomly generated passwords
4. For cloud deployments, use private VPC/network security groups

Example production database configuration:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/kpi_system?sslmode=require
```

### Data Encryption

The system encrypts sensitive data:

1. Passwords are stored using secure hashing (Argon2)
2. API keys and secrets are encrypted in the database
3. For additional security, enable database-level encryption

Enable encryption for backups:
1. Navigate to Admin → System Settings → Backup
2. Enable "Encrypt Backup Files"
3. Configure a secure encryption key

### Personal Data Handling

Comply with privacy regulations:

1. Navigate to Admin → Security → Privacy Settings
2. Configure data retention policies
3. Enable audit logging for personal data access
4. Configure data export capabilities for subject access requests
5. Implement data minimization principles

## Network Security

### HTTPS Configuration

Always use HTTPS in production:

1. Configure SSL/TLS in your web server or load balancer
2. Use minimum TLS 1.2 (TLS 1.3 recommended)
3. Implement proper certificate management
4. Configure secure cipher suites

Example NGINX HTTPS configuration:
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name kpi.example.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
    ssl_ciphers 'TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256:TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384';
    
    # HSTS (optional but recommended)
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
    
    # Other security headers
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
    add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
    add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; font-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'" always;
    
    # Application proxy settings
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

### Firewall Configuration

Configure firewalls to restrict access:

1. Allow only necessary ports:
   - 80/443 for web traffic
   - 22 for SSH (admin access only)
   - Database port (internal access only)

2. Use IP-based restrictions for admin interfaces

Example iptables configuration:
```bash
# Allow HTTP/HTTPS
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT

# Restrict SSH access
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP

# Allow database only from application server
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 5432 -s 127.0.0.1 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 5432 -j DROP
```

### API Security

If using the system's API:

1. Enable API authentication
2. Use API keys or OAuth tokens
3. Implement rate limiting
4. Monitor for abnormal usage patterns

Configure API security:
1. Navigate to Admin → Security → API Settings
2. Enable API authentication
3. Set rate limits
4. Configure allowed origins (CORS)

## System Hardening

### Docker Security

For Docker deployments:

1. Use the latest Docker version
2. Run containers with non-root users:
   ```yaml
   services:
     web:
       user: "1000:1000"  # Non-root user
   ```
3. Limit container capabilities
4. Use read-only file systems where possible
5. Implement resource limits

### Operating System Hardening

For traditional deployments:

1. Keep the OS updated with security patches
2. Remove unnecessary services and packages
3. Use SELinux or AppArmor
4. Implement secure file permissions
5. Configure host-based firewall rules

### Database Hardening

1. Run the database with a dedicated user
2. Limit database user permissions
3. Enable audit logging
4. Use prepared statements (built into the application)
5. Implement connection pooling with limits

## Security Monitoring

### Audit Logging

Enable comprehensive audit logging:

1. Navigate to Admin → Security → Audit Settings
2. Enable logging for:
   - Authentication events
   - Administrative actions
   - Data access
