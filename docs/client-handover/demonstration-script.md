Today, I'll be showing you how this system will transform your employee evaluation process from Excel spreadsheets to a comprehensive digital platform. We'll explore the main features including employee management, skill tracking, performance dashboards, and reporting. Feel free to ask questions as we go along, and we'll also have time for hands-on exploration at the end."

### 2. System Overview (5 minutes)
- Log in as the admin user
- Show the main dashboard
- Explain the overall navigation and interface
- Point out key areas: navigation menu, user profile, notifications

**Script:**

Notice how the navigation is organized by major functions - Employees, Evaluations, Reports, and Administration. The system is designed to be intuitive with a clean, modern interface that works on desktop computers and mobile devices."

### 3. Employee Management (10 minutes)

When I click on an employee, you can see their complete profile including contact information, current tier level, evaluation history, and skill ratings. Notice how easy it is to update information or create a new employee record."

### 4. Skill Evaluation Process (15 minutes)

I'll create a new evaluation for John Smith, a Craftsman level employee. Notice how the system presents all the relevant skill categories organized just like your current scorecard. For each skill, we can assign a rating from 1-5, matching your current scale. We can also track which tools the employee can operate and which they have as truck stock. When I complete and save the evaluation, we get this comprehensive summary that can be printed or exported."
