# Handyman KPI System Installer Progress

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Flask App Import Error
- Problem: `cannot import name 'app' from 'app'` error during startup
- Root Cause: Mismatch between app factory pattern and direct import expectations
- Fix: Added global app instance in `app/__init__.py` with `app = create_app()`

### 2. Python Path Handling
- Problem: Issues with module imports and path resolution
- Fix: Enhanced path handling in launcher.py with a dedicated setup function

### 3. Template Rendering Errors
- Problem: Errors when rendering error pages and referencing routes
- Fix: Updated templates to use simple_base.html and correct route references

## Blueprints Re-enabled

### Phase 1: Core Blueprints (Completed)
- Re-enabled `main` and `auth` blueprints
- Created necessary template files
- Updated template references

### Phase 2: Additional Blueprints (Planned)
The following blueprints will be re-enabled incrementally:
- Dashboard blueprint
- Employees blueprint
- Evaluations blueprint
- Reports blueprint
- Admin blueprint

## Testing Instructions

### Testing Core Functionality
1. Run the installer
2. Follow the installation steps
3. Launch the application
4. Verify the login page loads correctly
5. Test login functionality
6. Verify error pages render correctly

### Next Steps
1. Test with actual user credentials
2. Enable additional blueprints one by one
3. Complete full system testing

## Known Issues
- Limited functionality until all blueprints are re-enabled
- Database initialization needs to be tested thoroughly
- Some template files may need updates for consistency
