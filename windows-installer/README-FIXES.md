# Windows Installer Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Resource Files
- **Problem**: The build script attempted to copy logo.png and download icon.ico from GitHub, but both operations failed.
- **Solution**: 
  - Created placeholder logo.png and icon.ico files in the resources directory
  - Modified the build script to use these pre-created files instead of trying to download or copy them
  
### 2. Invalid Icon File
- **Problem**: The placeholder icon.ico file wasn't in a valid format for Inno Setup.
- **Solution**:
  - Removed icon references from the Inno Setup script
  - Commented out the SetupIconFile and UninstallDisplayIcon directives
  - Removed IconFilename parameters from shortcut definitions

### 3. Installer Script Path Issues
- **Problem**: The installer.iss file used the older {commonpf} constant which can cause issues on newer Windows versions.
- **Solution**: Updated to use {autopf} for better compatibility with modern Windows versions.

### 4. Missing Application Structure
- **Problem**: The minimal application structure needed for testing wasn't present.
- **Solution**: Created a complete basic Flask application structure:
  - Flask app initialization files
  - Route definitions
  - Templates and static files
  - Database directory
  - Utility functions

### 5. Launcher Problems
- **Problem**: The launcher script wasn't properly configured to start the Flask application.
- **Solution**: Updated the launcher.py to:
  - Properly initialize the application
  - Use Waitress as a production-ready WSGI server
  - Open the browser automatically
  - Handle errors gracefully

### 6. Application Launch Issues
- **Problem**: The application would start briefly and then close immediately after installation
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed the batch file to run Python directly instead of using the `start` command
  - Improved error handling in the launcher script
  - Added a delay before opening the browser
  - Simplified the Flask application structure to match our demo requirements

### 7. Tkinter Dependency Issue
- **Problem**: The embedded Python distribution didn't include tkinter which was required by the setup wizard
- **Solution**:
  - Replaced tkinter-based GUI wizard with a console-based setup process
  - Simplified Python package dependencies in build script
  - Added fallback options for missing modules
  - Implemented more robust error handling with detailed diagnostics

### 8. Windows Path Permission Issue
- **Problem**: Standard Windows users don't have write permissions to the Program Files directory
- **Solution**:
  - Moved data storage to the user's AppData directory instead of Program Files
  - Created dedicated application data folder within AppData
  - Improved error handling for directory and file creation
  - Added detailed logging and enhanced error messages

### 9. Flask App Import Errors
- **Problem**: The application failed with errors importing the Flask app object
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed the app module structure to properly expose the Flask app object
  - Enhanced import error handling with fallback methods
  - Added more detailed error reporting for troubleshooting
  - Created a simple wsgi.py file for running the application
  - Fixed installer privileges warning by using `PrivilegesRequiredOverridesAllowed`

## How to Build the Installer

1. Ensure all prerequisites are installed:
   - Inno Setup 6 or later
   - Git command-line tools
   - PowerShell 5.0 or later

2. Run the `build_installer.bat` script:
   ```
   cd C:\Users\dtest\KPI Project\windows-installer
   build_installer.bat
   ```

3. The installer will be created in the `output` directory.

## Testing the Installer

1. Run the generated installer file (handyman-kpi-system-setup.exe)
2. Follow the installation wizard
3. Launch the application from the Start Menu or Desktop shortcut
4. The application should open in your default web browser
5. Use the default login credentials:
   - Username: admin
   - Password: admin

### 10. Shortcut Creation Permission Errors
- **Problem**: The installer failed with "Access is denied" when creating desktop shortcuts
- **Solution**:
  - Changed installation privilege model to use `lowest` instead of `admin`
  - Updated shortcut creation to use user-specific desktop instead of common desktop
  - Changed default installation directory to use LocalAppData
  - Created a consistent permission model focusing on per-user installation

## Future Improvements

1. **Using full Python installer** instead of embedded distribution
   - Would allow for a GUI-based setup wizard (tkinter availability)
   - Would provide a better user experience for non-technical users
   - Results in larger installer but more professional appearance

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the installer:

1. Check the logs in `%TEMP%\handyman-kpi-setup.log`
2. Verify that all required dependencies were downloaded correctly
3. Ensure Inno Setup is properly installed and accessible from your PATH
4. Check that the resources directory contains the required logo.png and icon.ico files
5. For file permission issues, ensure the application has write access to `%APPDATA%\Handyman KPI System\`
6. For import errors, check the detailed error messages in the console window
