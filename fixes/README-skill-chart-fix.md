# Skill Rating Distribution Chart Fix

This document explains how to fix the display issue with the Skill Rating Distribution radar chart on the Dashboard page of the Handyman KPI System.

## Issue Description

The Skill Rating Distribution graph on the Dashboard page does not scale or fit correctly within its container, causing the following issues:

- Chart appears squished or distorted
- Labels are cut off or overlapping
- Chart doesn't resize properly when the window size changes
- Poor mobile responsiveness

## Solution

The fix involves three main components:

1. **CSS Improvements**
   - Better responsive container styling
   - Proper centering of the chart
   - Media queries for different screen sizes

2. **JavaScript Enhancements**
   - Improved Chart.js configuration
   - Better aspect ratio settings for radar charts
   - Window resize handling
   - Chart destruction and recreation to prevent duplicates

3. **HTML Template Updates**
   - Improved container structure
   - Added unique ID for targeted styling
