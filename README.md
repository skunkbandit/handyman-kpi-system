# Handyman KPI System

A comprehensive KPI (Key Performance Indicator) tracking system for handyman businesses with tiered skill structure (apprentice, handyman, craftsman, master craftsman, lead craftsman) and performance evaluation.

## Installation Fixes

This repository contains fixes for the Handyman KPI System installation process, addressing database path issues and terminal window problems.

### Issues Fixed

1. **Database Schema Issue**: 
   - Fixed SQLite error `no such column: users.employee_id` by updating the database schema
   - Added missing columns to match the expected schema
   - Implemented a database location fix to use AppData for proper write permissions
   - Added automatic database initialization during installation

2. **Terminal Window Issue**:
   - Fixed the issue where the console window stays open and if closed, it kills the application
   - Application now runs as a detached process with no visible console window
   - Modified desktop shortcut to use pythonw.exe instead of python.exe
   - Added a browser shortcut option for direct access

3. **CSRF Token Missing Error**:
   - Fixed "400 Bad Request: The CSRF token is missing" error when trying to add new employees
   - Added missing CSRF token input fields to employee forms

4. **User-Employee Linking Issue** (Added April 2, 2025):
   - Fixed issue where employee names weren't displaying in user management dropdowns
   - Updated templates to correctly reference the `name` field instead of non-existent `first_name`/`last_name` fields
   - Fixed field value mismatch between `employee_id` and `id` in templates
   - See [User-Employee Linking Fix README](fixes/README-user-employee-linking-fix.md) for details
